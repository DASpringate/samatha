This blog was built using the [Samatha](https://github.com/DASpringate/samatha) static site generator. Samatha is written entirely in R and is designed to allow blog posts to be simply written in Rmarkdown.  These posts are then translated to html by the Samatha engine.  Samatha also contains a simple, functional DSL for html generation.
Pages have been renderd using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and the xxx free bootstrap theme.
